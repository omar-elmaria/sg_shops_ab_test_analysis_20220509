# sg_shops_ab_test_analysis_20220509
This repo contains the scripts used to analyze the "shops" experiment in Singapore that targeted the **groceries** and **health and wellness** verticals

# 1. Objective of the project
The goal of the project was to **analyze the results of an AB test** that was launched in Singapore to test the effectiveness of a price differentiation strategy called **"Loved Brands"** on shop verticals. To know more about the strategy and what it entails, please check out this other [guide](https://github.com/omar-elmaria/loved_brands_automation) I created

# 2. Usability and Reproducability
This project was an **internal project** and used proprietary data sources and analysis methodologies. Even though you can clone the repo, the results **cannot** 
be reproduced on another machine due to data sharing restrictions. The code will simply give you an error because you don't have the necessary data access permissions. 

That said, if you are looking for some support in **designing** and **analyzing** AB tests, feel free to contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/omar-elmaria/).
